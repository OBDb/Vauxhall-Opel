## Generations

Vauxhall and Opel have a rich automotive history spanning over a century, with several key phases in the companies' development:

- **Early Years (1857-1925)**: Vauxhall was founded in 1857 as a pump and marine engine manufacturer in London, UK, before producing its first car in 1903. Opel began as a sewing machine manufacturer in 1862 in Rüsselsheim, Germany, and started automobile production in 1899. General Motors acquired Vauxhall in 1925.

- **GM Ownership Era (1925-2017)**: General Motors purchased Opel in 1929, creating a strong European presence with both Vauxhall and Opel. During this period, the brands became increasingly aligned, with Vauxhall models essentially being rebadged Opels adapted for the UK market, though maintaining separate brand identities. Key vehicle platforms were shared across both marques.

- **PSA Groupe Acquisition (2017-2021)**: In 2017, GM sold both Vauxhall and Opel to PSA Groupe (Peugeot-Citroën). This transition marked a significant shift as the brands began moving away from GM platforms to PSA architectures. New models like the Corsa, Mokka, and Astra were developed on PSA platforms.

- **Stellantis Era (2021-present)**: In 2021, PSA merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to form Stellantis, placing Vauxhall and Opel within one of the world's largest automotive groups. This era has seen increased focus on electrification, with both brands committing to all-electric lineups in the near future while continuing to share platforms with other Stellantis brands.
